# Quickstart

## 1. Install

```bash
# From the root of a checked-out math-inc/opengauss repository
./scripts/install.sh
```

The installer targets Linux checkouts, defaults runtime state to `~/.gauss/`, exposes `gauss` via `~/.local/bin/gauss`, prewarms `~/GaussWorkspace`, and registers it as the initial project. Interactive installs finish by opening `gauss-open-session`; if you run headless or pass `--no-launch`, reopen that launcher manually.

## 2. Open the CLI

```bash
gauss-open-session
```

## 3. The initial project is already ready

The installer preconfigures `~/GaussWorkspace` as the active Lean project for the managed workflows.

If you want to switch to an existing project:

```text
/project use /path/to/project
```

## 4. Launch a Lean workflow

```text
/prove
/draft "The next theorem statement"
/autoprove
/formalize --source ./paper.pdf "Theorem 3.2"
/autoformalize --source ./paper.pdf --claim-select=first --out=Paper.lean
```

## 5. What Gauss checks before launch

- the active project resolves to a valid `.gauss/project.yaml`
- the selected backend CLI is installed
- backend auth is available
- `uv` or `uvx` is available for the managed Lean MCP server
- the active project points at a Lean repository

If any check fails, Gauss stops before handoff and explains what is missing.
